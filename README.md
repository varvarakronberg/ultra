# Ultra Fun
The front-end part of this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is a demo of [react three fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) with real-time multi-user interactive UI through websockets using [socket.io](https://socket.io/).

State management is handled via [zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand).
